# Welcome to my homelab repository!

## About

Here are the various configuration files that I've used to help deploy parts of my homelab!

## Goals

I have three goals for this repository:

1. I want this repository to be a central location where I can keep all my configuration files in a reproducable state.

2. I want to learn about DevOps principles, such as IaC and CI/CD.

3. Along the way, as I learn something new, I want to write a blog post summarizing my experience in the hopes of helping others on the path.
